# Personal Website

This is the repository for my personal website: "wagnerdominik.at".
The whole website is done with HUGO.

The styling is self created. The SCSS pipeline from HUGO is used to transpile and minify all the styles.
The portfolio section gets all data from `/data/portfolio.json`. This data will be transformed by hugo on compile time.
